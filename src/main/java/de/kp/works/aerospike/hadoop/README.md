# Aerospike Graph: Hadoop support

**AerospikeGraph** implements a specific Hadoop *InputFormat* to read persisted keys and records from 
an Aerospike database cluster.

This input format defines the basis for vertex and edge readers that transform the Aerospike content
into Apache Spark DataFrames, which are compliant with the **GraphFrames** specification.

The Hadoop support (input) package contributes to the Liquid Big Data Analytics Continuum that offers
Apache Spark based Analytics for all flavors of Gartner's Analytics Continuum: Descriptive, diagnostic, 
predictive and prescriptive analytics.
